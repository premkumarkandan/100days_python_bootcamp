Task 1: Data Cleaning

    Read the data from sales_data.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.
    Check for missing values in each column and fill them with appropriate values. For example:
        Fill missing values in Quantity and Price with 0.
    Remove any rows where Total_Sales is 0 (if applicable).
    Correct data types if necessary, ensuring that Date is a datetime type and Quantity, Price, and Total_Sales are numeric.

Task 2: Data Manipulation

    Add a new column Total_Cost that calculates Quantity * Price.
    Correct any discrepancies between Total_Sales and Total_Cost, where Total_Sales may not match Quantity * Price.
        Use Total_Cost values to overwrite incorrect values in Total_Sales.
    Group data by Customer and Category to calculate the total sales amount each customer spent in each category.
    Filter the data to show only transactions where Total_Sales is above 200.

Task 3: Data Analysis

    Find the top 3 products in terms of total sales.
    Calculate the average quantity sold for each product category.
    Determine the month with the highest sales and display the total sales amount for that month.
